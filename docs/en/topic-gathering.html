                    <p>
                        As a tool for IT system governance and architectural governance, Enterprise Architecture is
                        widely adopted by many large enterprises. However, in practice, making sure the definition and
                        governance of enterprise architecture matching with the rapid changing business demands, and
                        consistent with the vision of innovation, have always been challenging.
                        <br/>
                        DDD, as a set of software and system design principles, put the right focus on the
                        responsiveness of the enterprise architecture.
                        <br/>
                        Topics under this theme will focus on applying DDD methods and practices in the Enterprise
                        Architecture field.

                    <p>
                        In 2014, the concept of Microservices became a hot topic and the concept of DDD soon became
                        widely accepted. In designing microservices architecture, DDD is considered as a guiding
                        ideology of microservice architecture design. We will continue to focus on how the industry
                        practice and design microservices architecture through Domain-Driven Design. At the same time,
                        we are also paying more attention to the latest technical practices such as Service Mesh, and
                        their impacts on service design.

                    <p>
                        Domain-Driven Design exercises are based on contiuously building the Ubiquitous Language. How to
                        build a unified language amongst different roles such as business, development, operation and
                        maintenance, is a problem that many DDD practitioners and teams are concerned about. Topics
                        under this theme will focus on the process of discovering and using ubiquitous language, and the
                        benefits to the team.

                        With the development of Domain-Driven Design practices, the working model of the team's Tech
                        Lead and/or Architect is also changing. The responsibility of the architect is changing from
                        defining the architectural elements for the team, towards providing the team with rapid feedback
                        and evolving the architecture continuously. In this theme, we will invite front-line architects
                        and technical leaders of the development teams to share through their practical experiences to
                        bring insights about what the architects are doing in the teams practicing DDD.

                        In 2017, Neal Ford, Rebecca Parson, and Patric Kua co-authored a book entitled "Building an
                        Evolutionary Architecture." A new architecture governance model was introduced to the industry.
                        The authors define the evolutionary architecture with three key attributes: incremental, guided,
                        and multi-dimension, which form a new way of constructing quick architectural feedback. In this
                        theme, we will focus on specific industry cases in the three dimensions of the evolutionary
                        architecture. We hope to help the audiences have a better understanding of the evolutionary
                        architecture.

                        In DDD China Summit 2017, unconference discussions around Domain-Driven Design and Function
                        Programming (FP) sparked some real interesting conversations. Participants conducted in-depth
                        discussions on how to integrate DDD principles and practices with FP. This year, we would like
                        to further discuss the applications of DDD in FP, Serverless, and Flow Based Programming. We
                        hope to take a glimpse on the role of Domain-Driven Design in the future of responsive design.

<div class="words content-container">
    <p class="word text-left">
        In December 2017, with the joint efforts of all participants and friends from communities, the very first Domain-Driven Design China Summit was successfully held. The conference attracted many leaders and practitioners of DDD at home and abroad. A number of rich industry cases shared during the conference brought a lot of inspiration to the participants.
    </p>
    <p class="word text-left">
        In the past half a year, many companies and teams have been trying hard to apply the principles of DDD upon their own business scenarios. Through establishing ubiqutious languages, the communication between business and technology becomes much more efficient, and the whole system responsiveness gets improved significantly.
    </p>
    <p class="word text-left">
        2018, we are back.
    </p>
    <p class="word text-left">
        At the beginning of December 2018, DDD China will be held again at the Beijing International Convention Center. We will invite leaders from DDD communities in Europe and North America, as well as representatives of many domestic teams who have dedicated their efforts to practice DDD. We will share with the industry the latest developments in DDD frontier. We hope that the DDD China 2018 will review and explore DDD practices and applications across many techonolgy domains, and hope to unveil some deeper prospects of DDD in the software industry.
