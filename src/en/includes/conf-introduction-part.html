        In December 2017, with the joint efforts of all participants and friends from communities, the very first Domain-Driven Design China Summit was successfully held. The conference attracted many leaders and practitioners of DDD at home and abroad. A number of rich industry cases shared during the conference brought a lot of inspiration to the participants.
