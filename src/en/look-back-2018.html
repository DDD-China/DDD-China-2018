                                Alberto Brandolini is a professional IT staff who gets bored with the days of doing the
                                same thing every day. This motivates him into unexplored fields such as Domain-Driven
                                Design, Lean and Agile software development, and Knowledge and Change Management. He
                                likes to bring obvious and chaotic ambiguity and comic-like visual impact to the
                                audience. He is an active software product development consultant running his own
                                company, Avanscoperta. He is also the author of "Introducing EventStorming - An Act of
                                Deliberative Collective Learning" and is often invited as a guest speaker to attend
                                Italian (his residence) and European conferences.

                                The fourth industrial revolution ignited a new era driven by science and technology.
                                Software has become the core competitiveness of this era. However, software engineers
                                today are not some preferred profession for many people. The super high speed growth and
                                even waves of disruptions have created a lot of uncertainty for us, forcing us to think
                                about new way(s) to survive this era. Domain-Driven Design has once again entered our
                                sight and has become an important method for us to respond to uncertainty.

                                As the vanguard of Alibaba’s new retail business, Hema is the first attempt in the real
                                sense, creating a supply chain system under China’s new retail model. Subverting the
                                traditional ERP thinking is the key to the continuous exploration of the Hema technology
                                in recent years. Internet+ traditional retail business is complex, and thus the domain
                                model has become particularly important in this complex system. It is different from the
                                traditional Internet e-commerce architecture. This session will explain in depth how
                                Domain-Driven Design evolves towards the Hema model, and how DDD is implemented under
                                the Internet architecture of Alibaba.

                                Limiting Domain-Driven Design to the scope of the technical architecture is obviously
                                devalue the true benefit of DDD, that is, how to “make the business domain-driven
                                architecture design”. In this topic, we will share how business analysts and architects
                                collaborate together to sort out business requirements, conduct product planning,
                                identify and divide business areas, sub-domains, and domain boundaries, establish a
                                conceptual relationship model, sort and define business service needs, establish a
                                common language in the "business side" and "technology side". We provide practical tips
                                for business analysts and architects to pair effectively.

                                Domain-Driven Design requires a unified language from business analysis to code
                                implementation, that is, the final code implemented is a complete expression of our
                                domain modeling. However, we have found that many teams did not do this when adopting
                                DDD, leaving the domain model in a form that did not play a significance later. In this
                                session, we will introduce some tools to help the team identify the code of the domain
                                model by visual means. It is the responsibility of everyone in the team to promote the
                                maintenance of the domain model.
